D. Edges and Hindrances
Edges and Hindrances are an integral part of character creation in Ruined York 3024.

Players can choose Edges and Hindrances to customize their characters and reflect their strengths, weaknesses, and personal histories.
Edges represent special abilities or advantages that give characters an edge in certain situations. These can include combat abilities, social skills, or unique talents. For example, a character may have the "Sharpshooter" Edge, granting them increased accuracy with ranged weapons, or the "Silver Tongue" Edge, making them more persuasive in negotiations. These Edges allow players to specialize their characters and excel in specific areas of gameplay.
Hindrances, on the other hand, represent challenges or disadvantages that characters must contend with. These Hindrances can take various forms, such as physical disabilities, personal vices, or emotional traumas. Hindrances provide depth and complexity to characters, as they must find ways to overcome or cope with these obstacles. For instance, a character may have the "One Eye" Hindrance, resulting in a penalty to perception checks, or the "Haunted" Hindrance, which causes occasional bouts of paranoia and fear. Hindrances add a level of realism and dramatic tension to the game, as characters must navigate their flaws and find creative solutions to overcome adversity.
During character creation, players will have a set number of points to allocate for both Edges and Hindrances. They can select Edges to enhance their character's abilities, while balancing them with Hindrances that present interesting challenges and opportunities for character growth.
It is important for players to choose Edges and Hindrances that align with their character's backstory, motivations, and role in the game. These choices can shape the character's narrative arc and interactions within the setting, allowing for engaging and dynamic gameplay.

When creating characters in Ruined York 3024, players have the opportunity to establish unique connections to the AI entities, The Wreck, or the elusive alien character. These connections provide additional depth to the characters and influence their interactions within the game world.
1. Connection to AI:
2. Players can choose to have a personal connection to one of the AI entities present in the game. This connection can manifest in various ways, such as a past association, a shared objective, or a mutual favor owed. The AI character can serve as a valuable ally, providing information, guidance, or even technological support. However, players must also navigate the complexities of dealing with artificial intelligence, as the AI's motivations and loyalties may not always align with their own.
3. Connection to The Wreck:
4. Characters can have a unique connection to the ethereal realm known as The Wreck. This connection might be due to a spiritual encounter, an ancestral tie, or a mysterious link established during their journey. The character's connection to The Wreck grants them access to supernatural abilities, glimpses into the spiritual realm, or the ability to communicate with the spirits inhabiting it. However, navigating The Wreck comes with risks, as it is a realm fraught with otherworldly creatures, perplexing riddles, and the potential for spiritual corruption.
5. Connection to the Elusive Alien:
6. In a rare occurrence, characters may have a direct connection to the enigmatic and elusive alien character. This connection can be a shared past encounter, a symbiotic bond, or a common goal. The connection offers the characters unique insights into the alien's true nature, granting them access to alien technologies, knowledge, or even the possibility of unraveling the alien's secrets. However, the character's connection also brings them into the orbit of other factions and individuals interested in the alien, exposing them to potential danger and intrigue.
These connections to AI, The Wreck, or the elusive alien provide players with narrative hooks, personal motivations, and additional avenues for character growth and development. Each connection adds layers of complexity and opportunities for role-playing within the game world, allowing characters to forge their own path and shape the unfolding story of Ruined York 3024.



III. Gameplay
A. Combat
Combat in Ruined York 3024 is intense and unforgiving, reflecting the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic wasteland. The rules for combat draw inspiration from Mörk Borg's d20 resolution system, emphasizing quick decision-making and strategic choices.
When engaging in combat, players roll a d20 to determine success or failure. They add their relevant combat-related attributes and skills to the roll, aiming to surpass the target number determined by the opponent's defenses. Successful hits inflict damage, and the severity of the damage depends on various factors, such as weapon type and critical hits.
In addition to straightforward combat encounters, players will also face tactical challenges and environmental hazards during fights. The ruined cityscape provides ample opportunities for cover, flanking, and improvisation. Players may choose to exploit their surroundings, utilizing the decaying buildings, rubble, or hidden passages to gain an advantage over their foes.
The enemies that players will encounter in Ruined York 3024 vary widely in their capabilities and threat levels. The section on enemies provides detailed descriptions of different adversaries, ranging from mutated creatures and rival survivors to rogue AI constructs and supernatural entities lurking within The Wreck. Each enemy type possesses unique abilities, weaknesses, and combat tactics, offering distinct challenges for players to overcome.
To maintain a progressively challenging combat experience as characters grow, enemy encounters should gradually increase in difficulty, both in terms of numbers and strength. Powerful adversaries may require players to employ clever strategies, teamwork, and efficient use of their resources. Engagements should provide opportunities for creative problem-solving beyond brute force, rewarding players for their tactical thinking and resourcefulness.
It is essential to balance combat encounters to ensure that they are challenging yet fair. Consider adjusting enemy numbers, abilities, and tactics based on the party's overall strength and capabilities. Playtesting is crucial to refine the combat mechanics and find the right balance, providing an exciting and engaging experience for players.

3. Diplomacy and Negotiation:
4. Interactions with factions, NPCs, and AI characters often require diplomacy and negotiation. Players may need to strike deals, form alliances, or resolve conflicts through dialogue and persuasion.

IV. Enemies
A. Mutant Rats
Mutant rats are a common threat in the ruins of New York City. These once ordinary rodents have been affected by the fallout from the Great Collapse, mutating into aggressive and formidable creatures. With their sharp teeth, heightened senses, and relentless nature, mutant rats pose a significant danger to survivors.
Description:
Mutant rats are larger and more ferocious than their pre-apocalyptic counterparts. They have grown in size, some reaching the size of small dogs, and their fur is matted and disheveled. Their eyes glow with an eerie green hue, reflecting their adaptation to the toxic environment. The rats' long, gnarled tails are covered in barbed spikes, which they use to strike at their prey.
Behavior:
Mutant rats are highly territorial and tend to form packs in abandoned buildings, sewers, and underground tunnels. They are known for their scavenging habits and will attack anything they perceive as a threat or as a potential food source. They are cunning and opportunistic, often using their keen senses and agility to launch surprise attacks.
Combat:
When engaging with mutant rats, survivors must be cautious and prepared for their swarming tactics. Their sharp teeth and claws can inflict painful bites and scratches, potentially leading to infections. When threatened or outnumbered, they can emit high-pitched screeches to call for reinforcements, making encounters with them even more challenging.
Strategies:
To effectively combat mutant rats, survivors may need to employ various strategies. Ranged weapons can be advantageous, allowing players to keep their distance and take them down before they get too close. Additionally, setting traps or using distractions can be effective in luring them away or thinning their numbers. However, caution must be exercised to avoid alerting other nearby enemies.
Rewards:
Defeating mutant rats may yield valuable resources. Their remains can be scavenged for components, such as mutated rat glands, which can have various uses in crafting healing items or chemical concoctions. Survivors who successfully exterminate a nest of mutant rats may also gain reputation within the survivor community, earning respect and potential alliances.
In the wasteland of Ruined York 3024, mutant rats are just one of the many threats survivors will encounter. Their aggressive nature, numbers, and ability to adapt to the harsh environment make them a formidable foe. Players must be vigilant, utilizing their skills and resources wisely to navigate encounters with these mutated rodents and emerge victorious from the battle for survival.


B. The Infected
Among the dangers that lurk in the desolate ruins of Ruined York 3024, the Infected pose a constant and horrifying threat to the survival of the players. These unfortunate souls have been transformed by the aftermath of the Great Collapse, succumbing to a mysterious affliction that has left them twisted, aggressive, and driven by primal instincts.
The Infected come in various forms, each with its own distinct characteristics and dangers. Some may exhibit enhanced physical abilities, while others may possess grotesque mutations that make them even deadlier. Their once-human features are distorted and marred, their eyes filled with a feral glint that speaks of their lost humanity.
In encounters with the Infected, players must be cautious and strategic, for these adversaries can quickly overwhelm the unprepared. Combat with the Infected can be brutal and unforgiving, requiring players to make quick decisions and use their skills effectively to survive. The Mörk Borg d20 resolution system lends itself well to capturing the tension and danger of these encounters, allowing for thrilling battles and desperate escapes.
However, not all interactions with the Infected need to end in bloodshed. Some infected individuals may still retain fragments of their former selves, struggling against their monstrous nature. Players may find opportunities to communicate, negotiate, or even help these tormented souls, offering glimpses of redemption in the harsh world they inhabit.
Dealing with the Infected is not without risks, as the affliction that plagues them is highly contagious. Players must exercise caution, weighing the potential rewards against the threat of infection. The consequences of succumbing to the Infected's curse can be dire, both physically and mentally, adding an additional layer of tension to their encounters.
Within this section, detailed descriptions and statistics for various types of Infected should be provided, allowing the game master to customize encounters and challenge the players at different stages of their journey. Strategies for fighting the Infected, as well as tips for role-playing encounters and capturing their eerie presence, should also be included to enhance the overall gaming experience.
Surviving encounters with the Infected will require resourcefulness, skill, and perhaps a touch of luck. The ruins of Ruined York 3024 are haunted by these twisted remnants of humanity, serving as a constant reminder of the devastating effects of the Great Collapse. The players' ability to navigate this perilous landscape and overcome the Infected will test their mettle and determine their fate in this unforgiving world.

They are known for their ruthless tactics, fierce independence, and unwavering determination to control territory and resources.
1. Faction Description
The Renegades operate as a loosely organized group, consisting of diverse individuals from different backgrounds who share a common disdain for centralized power. They view themselves as freedom fighters and rebels, standing against any form of oppression or control. Renegades are often skilled fighters, adept at survival in the harsh wasteland.
2. Renegade Outposts
Renegade groups establish fortified outposts in strategic locations throughout the city, using their ingenuity to repurpose ruined buildings and structures. These outposts serve as bases of operations, providing shelter, protection, and a sense of community for the Renegades.
3. Combat Tactics
When it comes to combat, the Renegades are known for their guerrilla tactics and resourcefulness. They rely on ambushes, hit-and-run tactics, and traps to gain the upper hand against their enemies. Renegades prefer to strike swiftly and retreat into the shadows, using their knowledge of the urban landscape to their advantage.
4. Renegade Leaders
Within the Renegade ranks, charismatic and influential leaders emerge to rally their fellow survivors. These leaders have their own motivations and agendas, and their loyalties can be unpredictable. Some seek to establish a new order, while others simply desire to sow chaos and anarchy.

Successfully navigating encounters with the Renegades can lead to valuable resources, alliances, or access to restricted areas. However, crossing them or becoming their enemies can have severe consequences, as the Renegades are not known for showing mercy to those they perceive as threats.
In summary, the Renegades represent a formidable faction within the post-apocalyptic world of Ruined York 3024. Their independent and rebellious nature, coupled with their combat prowess, make them a force to be reckoned with.

D. The Reapers
In the desolate wastelands of Ruined York 3024, one group of enemies stands out as particularly fearsome and relentless - The Reapers. These enigmatic figures strike fear into the hearts of survivors, and tales of their cruelty and mercilessness are whispered among those who dare to speak their name.
The Reapers are a fanatical cult that has emerged from the shadows of the post-apocalyptic world. They believe that the Great Collapse was a divine punishment for humanity's sins, and they see themselves as the chosen instruments of this higher power. Clad in tattered black robes, their faces hidden behind grim masks, the Reapers move silently through the ruins, carrying out their mysterious and often violent agenda.
These dangerous adversaries possess a level of organization and discipline that sets them apart from other factions in Ruined York. Their ranks consist of skilled fighters, adept in various forms of combat, ranging from hand-to-hand combat to expert marksmanship. Each Reaper is trained to exploit weaknesses and strike with deadly precision.
The Reapers' primary objective is to cleanse the city of what they perceive as impurities, which includes any survivors who do not adhere to their fanatical beliefs. They ruthlessly hunt down those they deem unworthy, showing no mercy and leaving behind only death and despair.
Encountering The Reapers is a harrowing experience for players. Stealth, cunning, and strategic thinking are essential when confronting these relentless adversaries. Engaging in direct combat with them is not for the faint of heart, as they fight with brutal efficiency and coordinated tactics.
However, The Reapers are not simply mindless killing machines. Behind their dark façade, there are whispers of a deeper purpose and hidden agenda. Unraveling the mysteries of this cult and understanding their motivations could uncover secrets that will shape the fate of Ruined York.
Game Masters can use The Reapers as a recurring and formidable presence throughout the campaign. Their presence adds an element of tension and danger, keeping players on edge as they navigate the treacherous ruins of the city. Defeating The Reapers may require careful planning, forming alliances, and exploiting their weaknesses.
Whether players choose to confront The Reapers head-on or attempt to outmaneuver them, one thing is certain - they will need to summon all their skills, courage, and resourcefulness to survive the relentless pursuit of these fearsome enemies.

E. The Sirens
The Sirens are a haunting presence in the desolate ruins of Ruined York. These enigmatic and alluring creatures possess an otherworldly beauty that draws unsuspecting wanderers into their grasp. Legends and rumors surround the Sirens, describing them as captivating, yet deadly beings that lurk in the shadows.
The Sirens are masters of deception and seduction. They possess an innate ability to manipulate minds, using their ethereal voices to weave irresistible melodies that enchant and enthrall. Those who succumb to their melodic charms become enthralled followers, slaves to the Sirens' will.
Encountering a Siren can be a perilous situation, as they are not easily defeated. Their supernatural allure makes it difficult for even the most seasoned survivors to resist their enchantment. Once under their control, victims may be compelled to carry out the Sirens' bidding, willingly subjecting themselves to danger or turning against their own allies.
The Sirens' methods of attack vary, as they prefer to use their mesmerizing voices as weapons rather than engaging in direct combat. Their haunting melodies can induce confusion, fear, or even hallucinations, disorienting those who listen to their songs. Their alluring voices can also drain the life force of their victims, leaving them weakened and vulnerable.
Beware, for the Sirens are cunning and elusive adversaries. They tend to dwell near bodies of water, their eerie songs carried by the wind, drawing unsuspecting travelers closer to their lairs. It is said that they are most active during the twilight hours, when the fading light amplifies their otherworldly presence.
Devising strategies to counter the Sirens requires caution and cleverness. Characters may need to rely on their willpower and mental fortitude to resist the enchanting melodies. Protective measures such as earplugs or enchanted artifacts might offer some defense against their charms. Working together and relying on the unique abilities of each character will be crucial in overcoming the Sirens' allure and surviving their deadly grasp.
In Ruined York 3024, encountering the Sirens will test the characters' resolve, as they must resist the temptation of the Sirens' enchantments and find a way to neutralize or outsmart these captivating adversaries. The fate of the survivors hangs in the balance, and their ability to overcome the Sirens' allure will determine whether they can navigate the treacherous wasteland and uncover the secrets hidden within the ruins of New York City.

F. Other Enemies
In addition to the common threats that players may encounter in Ruined York 3024, there are other enemies lurking in the shadows of the city, ready to challenge the resilience of the survivors. These adversaries possess unique characteristics and present formidable obstacles for the players to overcome.
1. The Bio-Mechanoids:
2. These twisted creations of the Great Collapse are a fusion of organic and mechanical elements. As remnants of experimental projects gone awry, Bio-Mechanoids stalk the ruins, driven by a relentless desire to harvest the remaining resources for their own mysterious purposes. With their powerful cybernetic enhancements and lethal weaponry, facing a Bio-Mechanoid is a life-or-death struggle.
3. The Cultists of the Abyss:
